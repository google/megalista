## How does it work
Megalista was design to separate the configuration of conversion/audience upload rules from the engine, giving more freedom for non-technical teams (i.e. Media and Business Inteligence) to setup multiple upload rules on their own.

The solution consists of #1 a configuration environment (either Google Sheet or JSON file, or a Google Cloud Firestore collection) in which all rules are defined by mapping a data source (BigQuery Table) to a destination (data upload endpoint) and #2, an Apache Beam workflow running on Google Dataflow, scheduled to upload the data in batch mode.

## Prerequisites

## Installation

### Configure Megalista
Megalista can be configured via Google Sheets, a JSON file or a Google Cloud Firestore collection. Expected data schemas (Sources) and metadata (Destinations) for each use case defined in [the Megalista Wiki](https://github.com/google/megalista/wiki).

To configure using Google Sheets:
 - Make a copy of the [Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mu0yj7RWw_cr3bevWCnjXyODlCbdmabWDLsBvPv2EVY?resourcekey=0-ZqbZ72FJVIa8X4YgelHUHA)
 - In the "Intro" sheet provide Account IDs for Google Ads, Analytics, CM360, etc.
 - Configure source/input data in the "Sources" sheet
 - Configure destinations in the "Destinations" sheet
  + The "Help" sheet has a chart to document the required metadata for each use case.
 - Configure connections from Sources to Destinations in the "Connect" sheet
 - Make note of the Sheet's ID in the URL: `docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`**EXAMPLEIDHERE**`/edit`

 To configure using JSON:
 - Make a copy of the [JSON template](https://github.com/google/megalista/tree/main/cloud_config/configuration_sample.json)
 - Provide Account IDs for Google Ads, Analytics, CM360, etc.
 - Configure Sources and Destinations, separating entries with commas
 - Connect Sources to Destinations in the "Connections" field
 - Save and upload this JSON file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket (default bucket options are fine)
 - Make note of the files's Authenticated URL in the Cloud Storage UI: `storage.cloud.google.com/`**mybucketname/myconfig.json**

 To configure using Firestore (recommended for use with web interface - WIP):
 - Verify that the Firestore API is enabled on Google Cloud (see the APIs section)
 - Create a [collection](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model) in Firestore, with the name of your choice
 - Inside the collection, create a Firestore document named "account_config", and provide Account IDs for Google Ads, Analytics, CM360, etc. See schema below.
 - Inside the collection, create separate Firestore documents for each Source/Destination pair. See schema below.

### Creating required access tokens
To access campaigns and user lists on Google's platforms, this dataflow will need OAuth tokens for a account that can authenticate in those systems.

In order to create it, follow these steps:
 - Access GCP console
 - Go to the **API & Services** section on the top-left menu.
 - On the **OAuth Consent Screen** and configure an *Application name*
 - Then, go to the **Credentials** and create an *OAuth client Id* with Application type set as *Desktop App*
 - This will generate a *Client Id* and a *Client secret*
 - Run the **generate_megalista_token.sh** script in this folder providing these two values and follow the instructions
   - Sample: `./generate_megalista_token.sh client_id client_secret`
 - This will generate the *Access Token* and the *Refresh token*

### Creating a bucket on Cloud Storage
This bucket will hold the deployed code for this solution. To create it, navigate to the *Storage* link on the top-left menu on GCP and click on *Create bucket*. You can use Regional location and Standard data type for this bucket.

## Running Megalista

We recommend first running it locally and make sure that everything works.
Make some sample tables on BigQuery for one of the uploaders and make sure that the data is getting correctly to the destination.
After that is done, upload the Dataflow template to GCP and try running it manually via the UI to make sure it works.
Lastly, configure the Cloud Scheduler to run Megalista in the frequency desired and you'll have a fully functional data integration pipeline.

### Running locally
Only set one configuration parameter (setup_sheet_id, setup_json_url or setup_firestore_collection)
```bash
python3 megalista_dataflow/main.py \
  --runner DirectRunner \
  --developer_token ${GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN} \
  --setup_sheet_id ${CONFIGURATION_SHEET_ID} \
  --setup_json_url ${CONFIGURATION_JSON_URL} \
  --setup_firestore_collection ${CONFIGURATION_FIRESTORE_COLLECTION}
  --refresh_token ${REFRESH_TOKEN} \
  --access_token ${ACCESS_TOKEN} \
  --client_id ${CLIENT_ID} \
  --client_secret ${CLIENT_SECRET} \
  --bq_ops_dataset %{BQ_OPS_DATASET} \
  --project ${GCP_PROJECT_ID} \
  --region us-central1 \
  --temp_location gs://{$GCS_BUCKET}/tmp
```

### Deploying Pipeline
To deploy the full Megalista pipeline, use the following command from the root folder:
`./terraform_deploy.sh`

#### Manually executing pipeline using Dataflow UI
To execute the pipeline, use the following steps:
- Go to **Dataflow** on GCP console
- Click on *Create job from template*
- On the template selection dropdown, select *Custom template*
- Find the *megalista* file on the bucket you've created, on the templates folder
- Fill in the parameters required and execute

### Scheduling pipeline
To schedule daily/hourly runs, go to **Cloud Scheduler**:
- Click on *create job*
- Add a name and frequency as desired
- For *target* set as HTTP
- Configure a *POST* for url: https://dataflow.googleapis.com/v1b3/projects/${YOUR_PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/templates:launch?gcsPath=gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/templates/megalista, replacing the params with the actual values
- For a sample on the *body* of the request, check **cloud_config/scheduler_sample.json**
- Add OAuth Headers
- Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform

#### Creating a Service Account
It's recommended to create a new Service Account to be used with the Cloud Scheduler
- Go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
- Create a new Service Account with the following roles:
    - Cloud Dataflow Service Agent
    - Dataflow Admin
    - Storage Objects Viewer


## Usage
Every upload method expects as source a BigQuery data with specific fields, in addition to specific configuration metadata. For details on how to setup your upload routines, refer to the [Megalista Wiki](https://github.com/google/megalista/wiki) or the [Megalista user guide](https://github.com/google/megalista/blob/main/documentation/Megalista%20-%20Technical%20User%20Guide%20-%20EXTERNAL.pdf).

## Note about Google Ads API access
Calls to the Google Ads API will fail if the user that generated the OAuth2 credentials (Access Token and Refresh Token) doesn't have direct access to the Google Ads account which the calls are being directed to. It's not enough for the user to have access to a MCC above this account and being able to access the account through the interface, it's required that the user has permissions on the account itself.
